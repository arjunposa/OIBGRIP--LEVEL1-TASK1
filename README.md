Landing Page- This project shows a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Here, I learned how to divide sections, add headers and footers, add columns, and arrange items. Most importantly, I applied my creativity to make the page appear impressive. The boxes, padding, color scheme, alignments, and every other element.
